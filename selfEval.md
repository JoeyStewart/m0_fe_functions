# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I just had a lot of fun figuring out the problems. I referened past assignments and it was rewarding to put them together without
much trouble. Methods and functions had actually been a very difficult concept for me in past classes, put I was able to pick up
the concepts and apply them easily. Great instructions and having assignments broken down have really helped build that foundational knowledge that I have been looking for. 

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
Functions give the developer the tools to create their own methods. This allows us to create methods for very niche reasons. Or it could save you time to create your own method if you are having trouble finding the right one. It opens the possibilites to do much more than what is only defined and built into javascript itself.
